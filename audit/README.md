## Recommendations

* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider removing the requirement to set non-0 approval limits to 0 before modifying the limit to a new non-0 limit - see NOTE
  in [ERC20 - `approve(...)`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md#approve).
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `icoEtherContributedOf(...)` is redundant as the exact same result is provided by the autogenerated getter function
  `icoEtherContributed(...)`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `icoTokensReceivedOf(...)` is redundant as the exact same result is provided by the autogenerated getter function
  `icoTokensReceived(...)`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `isRefundClaimed(...)` is redundant as the exact same result is provided by the autogenerated getter function
  `refundClaimed(...)`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `isAirdropClaimed(...)` is redundant as the exact same result is provided by the autogenerated getter function
  `airdropClaimed(...)`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** *ERC20Token* should implement the functions required under the
  [ERC20 token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md), including `totalSupply()`
